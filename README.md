[Explore the scene](https://shark-animation-xriykgapld.now.sh/): this link takes you to a copy of the scene deployed to a remote server where you can interact with it just as if you were running `dcl start` locally.

**Install the CLI**

Download and install the Decentraland CLI by running the following command

```bash
npm i -g decentraland
```

For a more details, follow the steps in the [Installation guide](https://docs.decentraland.org/documentation/installation-guide/).


**Previewing the scene**

Once you've installed the CLI, download this example and navigate to its directory from your terminal or command prompt.

_from the scene directory:_

```
$:  dcl start
```

Any dependencies are installed and then the CLI will open the scene in a new browser tab automatically.

**Usage**

Click on the shark to toggle the `bite` animation on and off. The `swim` animation should be always on.
